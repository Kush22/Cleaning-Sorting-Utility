<h1 id="welcome-to-innocleaner">Welcome to InnoCleaner</h1>
<p>This is a Cleaning &amp; File Sorting Utility which is developed by me as a submission for <strong>Innovaccer HackerCamp 18</strong> under the assignment title <strong>Infrastructure Engineering Assignment</strong></p>
<p>The problem statement for the implemented project is: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1azvXBMhBmhiFRDDTR3cDegJUNTxvg3ak/view">Infrastructure Engineering Assignment</a></p>
<h1 id="required-functionality"><strong>Required Functionality</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>Scan the specified path in the file system to display top 10 largest sized files.</li>
<li>Move the files on Desktop based on extension and save them in Documents folder clubbed in folders according to extension.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let us describe what InnoCleaner is:</p>
<p>InnoCleaner is a UNIX based CLI cleaner utility that gives the user a tool to perform disk cleanup and related capabilities.</p>
<h1 id="functionality-implemented"><strong>Functionality Implemented</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>Scan and Save Space : Given the path and number of files to list, it can recursively scan the path to display the largest sized files(Further operations include):
<ul>
<li>Delete file(s):
<ul>
<li>For this choose the corresponding option and specify the file(s) (space separated if multiple)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Compressing file(s):
<ul>
<li>Similar to compression, specify the file(s) (space separated if multiple)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Stats about the amount of space saved are then displayed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Sorting : Given the path of a <em>source</em> and <em>destination</em>, the files in <em>source</em> folder are sorted according to extension and saved folder-wise in the destination location</li>
<li>Duplicity : Given a path, InnoCleaner recursively scans the path for detecting duplicate files.</li>
<li>Cleanup : On selecting the Cleanup Option, the temp files are cleaned.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="future-improvements"><strong>Future Improvements</strong></h1>
<p>No project is complete without a list of improvements &amp; InnoCleaner is no exception. The list of improvements can be never ending:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the modules are python3 dependent. Provide backward compatibility to python 2 also (atleast from python 2.7)</li>
<li>Right now the module is tested only for UNIX environments. Test and make the module cross-platform compatible.</li>
<li>Separate compression algorithms work better with different types of files. So have a list of compression algos corresponding to the file extension and by checking the file extension, use the best possible to save most space.</li>
<li>Just detecting duplicate files isn't of much use. So provide option to clean the duplicate files too. Since a lot of files may be duplicated, first display only limited number of files, ask for any deletion and then proceed further. Also provide an option to clean all duplicate files (if the user does not want to select explicitly).</li>
<li>Detection of Obsolete files : Based on the modified dates, obsolete files may be displayed to be cleaned up or compressed.</li>
</ul>
